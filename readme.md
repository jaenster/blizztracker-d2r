# Blizz tracker @ D2R forums

Simple hacky piece of typescript to poll the forums of blizzard and put post the results to a discord embedded formatted webhook

# Config
Put the webhook in `settings.json`, you can add multiple webhooks if you prefer

# How to start?
1) Install node
2) `npm install`
3) `npm start`

or if you got yarn, `yarn && yarn start`

# Why is this code so ugly
I wrote it quick and dirty, not meant to be pretty. Just a hacky thing because I was tired of scrolling the forums
